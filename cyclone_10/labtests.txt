20.1.2019:

managed to make aux voltage control somewhat work. Tested up to 150V dc link voltage with boost switching at 30 count pulse width.


24.1.2019

Aux control tests ok. aux stays in regulation up to 220VAC input voltage. Succesful tests for input voltage measurement. Todo, test dc link voltage.

test 30k/3k aux gains up to 220vin/310VDC link

25.1.2019

no more labtests, remember to record dclink measurement


31.1.2019

successfully test burst mode with 90 clk pulsewidth

3.2.2019

successfully test llc with synchronous rectifiers with no load

4.2.2019

succesful test with llc and 4x3r9 ohm load. Auxiliary supply fets and charge resistor burned.

5.2


changed aux fets and charge resistor. everything seems fine after test with 32vdc input


======== V5 hardware =========

24.4
tested aux supply, 5v pri voltage has ~100mV ripple. add more capacitance

System burned after consequent starts, charge resistor and aux
IC all burned
	- happened after system was started without control card with 230VAC
	- the problem was most likely PFC SiC fet, which does not have pulldown
	  resistors on the gate.

25.4(master)
	everything works again after fet, charge resistor and iw1818 change
		- issue with missing pulldown resistors from pfc fet gates
		- fet confirmed burned. measurements have significant noise from
		  supply, two stage rc filter was added after aux 5v, seems to have
		  fixed issues

mean of mains voltage measurement is 2059



14.5 master

tested dhb with 2500ohm load.
High power triggered when phase shift was > 25, but not every time.
approximately 350W was drawn from supply. DHB secondary caps heated
significantly. possibly reversal of phase ?? triggered when new phase shift
was loaded from uart
