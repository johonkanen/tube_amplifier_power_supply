5. KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS

  The following are known issues for this core at time of release:

  5.1 ISE
    - Output bus indices in .ASY file do not match instantiation template bus indices
      when a custom output width is selected.
       - The indices of the P output bus will be P[X:Y] in the .ASY file and P[X-Y:0] in
         the core instantiation template.
       - Affects schematic flow only.
       - Manually editing the .ASY file to correct the bus width can work around this issue.
       - CR456322 and CR435084
       - Answer Record 30807

    - Block Memory resource estimates may be inaccurate for constant-coefficient multipliers
      with large constants and large A input widths (> 35 bits)
       - The map report should be consulted to determine the true block memory count
       - CR469169
       - Answer Record 30810
